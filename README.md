You found it!

William Moore's Repository of MicroPython Programs and other teaching materials.

I have created a branch called "Microbit-Pong-Games".

Now all I need to do is to see if I can find it... and how (or should I) 

move my Simple Pong files over there??? I want to maybe keep this as  my 

"root" directory. Is that a valid concept on GitHub with all it branches?

I'm still a newby when it comes to using and developing content on GitHub. 

So, expect mistakes, and offer advice for improving things here.
