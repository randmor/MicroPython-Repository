William Moore's Repository of MicroPython Programs and other teaching materials.

Seems to me that GitHub would be a good online repository for lessons, lab exercises, 
demo programs, and advanced programs that my students could access from school. Since 
the school does not allow outside ASE (After School Education) teachers to pust stuff 
up on the school's servers, GitHub seems like a reasonable alternative.

I will be revising my class lessons in the form of ".py" files that contain both 
instructive information as well as small "lesson appropriate" demo programs that 
students can "cut and paste" into their MicroPython Editor (Online or Mu).
